# Fry
=======
This is a website built with Jekyll. I used an [open source theme](https://github.com/lllychen/fry) which I found while browsing [this list](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme). 

Description:
Fry is [Louie](https://github.com/lllychen/louie)'s much more graphic-heavy, photogenic brother (still a Jekyll theme tho).
